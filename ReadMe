#there is two set of volunteer, one will do the test, one will do the training
#feature.txt include the code and all the features/measurement categories
#y train and y_test match the activity label with the recording data in x txt
#activty label: the code and the corresponding activty names
#subject test identify the subject by using code

=>>> first we load the data, and find the common column. Work with both train 
and test folder THEN combine the two dataset
Move on to the feature. txt -> read it and extract only the measurement with std
and mean it its name. Jsing grep() to create index locating the feature that has
mean or std on its name

Use descriptive names to names the activity in the dataset
match the activity label in y dataset with the activity label.txt. Used match()
and assigned the new values to activity label column in the big dataset

Label data set with descriptive names USING features txt that only has mean
#and STD value , assign the name to data_all2. Add +2 to the feeature index since we just added the activty and subject column in the big X dataset

Finally create a tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Used aggregate()
