#there is two set of volunteer, one will do the test, one will do the training
#feature.txt include the code and all the features/measurement categories
#y train and y_test match the activity label with the recording data in x txt
#activty label: the code and the corresponding activty names
#subject test identify the subject by using code

=>>> first we load the data, and find the common column. Work with both train 
and test folder THEN combine the two dataset
Move on to the feature. txt -> read it and extract only the measurement with std
and mean it its name
Label the dataset
Finally create a tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
